Check to see if a string of parentheses is balanced or not.

By "balanced," we mean that for every open parenthesis, there is a matching closing parenthesis in 
the correct order. For example, the string "((()))" has three pairs of balanced parentheses, so it 
is a balanced string. On the other hand, the string "(()))" has an imbalance, as the last two 
parentheses do not match, so it is not balanced.  Also, the string ")(" is not balanced because the 
close parenthesis needs to follow the open parenthesis.

The program should take a string of parentheses as input and return True if it is balanced, or False 
if it is not. In order to solve this problem, use a Stack data structure.

Function name:
is_balanced_parentheses

Remember: this is not a method within the Stack class, this is a separate function.  Indent all the 
way to the left.
