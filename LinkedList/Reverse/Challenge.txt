Create a new method called reverse that reverses the order of the nodes in the list, i.e., the first 
node becomes the last node, the second node becomes the second-to-last node, and so on.

Do not change the value of any of the nodes.

Once all nodes have been done, must update the head and tail pointers to reflect the new order of the nodes.
